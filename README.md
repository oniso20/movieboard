## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The web application is developed with little HTML, CSS is primarily used for styling the movie cards and the web design. The data of the movies, images, overview and rating is fetched from the TMDB API. You can read more about the API here - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to implement a search functionality to find movies based on key words.
